   -Start of project

12 Jan 2006 (TG)
   -Created two different project/solution sets, one for VS.NET 2003/.NET 1.1
	    and one for VS.NET 2005/.NET 2.0.

16 Jan 2006 (TG)
   -Fixed a bug where trying to add a 'null' object to the cache would throw
	  an exception.

17 Jan 2006 (MM)
   -Fixed the bug where an exception would be thrown and not taken care of
	  when a socket pool thread would terminate.
   -Cleaned up the time comparison stuff in the socket pool.

18 Jan 2006 (TG)
   -Enabled log4net to work on the client library and in the MemCachedBench
	    program.
   -Removed the overridden GetHashCode function in SockIO, which was a carry
	    over from the java port, because it was causing problems and 
	    shouldn't be necessary.
   -Fixed a bug where a connection pool could not be closed cleanly.
   
23 Jan 2006 (TG)
   -Huge overhaul of code.  Basically ran the client library through FxCop
    	    (http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/fxcop/) and tried to fix every
    	    error.  There are breaking changes, but this should be the
    	    one and only time this ever happens.
   -Internationalized the exception messages and log messages.
   -Added 2 FxCop projects (one for .NET 1.1 and one for .NET 2.0) and a
   	    custom dictionary file to add our custom words for FxCop.
   -Removed the NestedIOException class because the .NET IOException class
            can do inner exceptions.
   -Split off SockIO class into it's own source file.

   -Bugfix.  There were problems where the busy and available pools were
	     continually being created over and over again.  This has been
	     fixed and not only does this solve a very subtle outstanding
	     bug, but it also results in a massive performance increase!
   -Bugfix.  Fixed the code where we treat the input and output stream
	     of a SockIO object as two different objects when .NET just
	     treats them as a single object.  This was a hold-over from 
	     java.

   -Performance. Turns out that the thorough (sp?) logging throughout the
		 library was part of its performance downfall :).  There
		 was a lot of string concatenation and hashtable lookups,
		 which by themselve don't really do much.  However, if you
		 Do 100,000 hashtable lookups (because all the messages
		 are internationalized), and 50,000 string concatenations
		 it starts to all add up.  I wrapped every logging statement
		 with a boolean lookup on log4net which can check to see
		 if we're even going to log the message, and if not, don't
		 even do the work involved in logging.  If you turn off 
		 logging, or turn it up to some high level like "WARN" or 
		 "ERROR", then you will see a pretty significant performance
		 benefit, CPU usage down significantly, and network usage
		 up significantly.

   -Bugfix.	Workaround incorporated to work around the bug in
   		BufferedStream.  BufferedStream calls Seek() on streams it
   		wraps even if the underlying stream does not support Seek()
   		(such as NetworkStream).
  
21 November 2006 (TG)
   Upgrade.	Upgraded the log4net libraries to 1.2.10.  Split the /lib
   		folder into a 1.1 and 2.0 directories.

   Signed assembly
   		I added a keyfile to the solution so that the client library
   		can be strongly typed.  There may be some debate whether or
   		not the key should be secret, but this is just easier this 
   		way.  If people are worried about a modified assembly file
   		I can start posting MD5 or SHA1 hashes of the binaries
   		on the project page.

7 June 2007 (TG)
   -Bugfix.	Applied a patch from a contributer (thanks Dave Peckham!) that 
                fixes a bug where we don't get the proper size of the buffer.
                In many cases the code would still work fine, but you may 
                have experienced periodic errors when working with very large
                objects, or seeing wasted space on your memcached servers.
